Your B2B database is rotting. Right now, as you read this, contacts are changing jobs, companies are getting acquired, and emails are becoming invalid.

The industry benchmark: B2B data decays at approximately 22.5% per year. In some industries, it's as high as 70%.

That means if you don't actively maintain your database, nearly a quarter of your contacts will be outdated within 12 months.

## What Causes Data Decay

Data decay isn't random. It's driven by predictable business events:

### Job changes

**Rate**: 15-20% of professionals change jobs annually

The average tenure at a company has dropped to 4.1 years (Bureau of Labor Statistics). In tech, it's even shorter—often 2-3 years.

When someone changes jobs:
- Their email becomes invalid
- Their job title is wrong
- Their company association is outdated
- Their phone number likely changes

A single job change invalidates most fields in a contact record.

### Company changes

**Rate**: 5-10% of companies undergo major changes annually

- Acquisitions (email domains change)
- Mergers (company names change)
- Rebrands (names and domains change)
- Bankruptcies (everything becomes invalid)
- Restructuring (titles and departments change)

When Acme Corp acquires TechStartup, every TechStartup contact needs updating.

### Contact information changes

**Rate**: 10-15% of email addresses change annually

Even without job changes, contact info changes:
- Companies migrate email systems
- Domain names change
- People get promoted (new email alias)
- Office relocations (phone numbers change)

### Data entry errors

**Rate**: 2-5% of records have errors at creation

Data decay isn't just about change—it includes data that was wrong from the start:
- Typos in email addresses
- Wrong company associations
- Incorrect job titles
- Incomplete information

These errors compound over time as they propagate through systems.

## Data Decay by Industry

Decay rates vary significantly by industry:

| Industry | Annual Decay Rate | Primary Driver |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Technology | 25-35% | High job mobility |
| Startups/VC-backed | 30-40% | Company changes, high turnover |
| Professional Services | 20-25% | Job mobility, firm changes |
| Financial Services | 15-20% | Regulatory changes, mergers |
| Healthcare | 20-30% | Regulatory turnover, acquisitions |
| Manufacturing | 10-15% | Lower turnover, stable companies |
| Government | 8-12% | Long tenure, stable organizations |

If you sell to startups and tech companies, your data decays faster than average.

## Data Decay by Field

Not all fields decay equally:

| Field | Annual Decay Rate | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Work email | 20-30% | Highest decay—tied to employment |
| Job title | 15-25% | Promotions, reorgs, job changes |
| Direct phone | 15-20% | Changes with job, office moves |
| Company | 10-15% | Job changes, acquisitions |
| Mobile phone | 5-10% | Personal, more stable |
| LinkedIn URL | 3-5% | Rarely changes |
| Name | 1-2% | Very stable (marriage, legal) |

Email decays fastest because it's directly tied to employment status.

## Measuring Your Data Decay

You can measure decay in your own database:

### Method 1: Bounce rate tracking

Track email bounce rates over time:

```
January: 2% bounce rate
April: 4% bounce rate
July: 6% bounce rate
October: 8% bounce rate
```

If bounce rates increase 1-2% per quarter, your data is decaying as expected.

### Method 2: Sample verification

Take a random sample of records and verify them:

1. Export 500 random contacts
2. Run through email verification
3. Call 50 phone numbers
4. Check 100 LinkedIn profiles against titles

Calculate the percentage that fail. That's your current decay level.

### Method 3: Engagement decay

Track engagement metrics over contact age:

| Contact Age | Open Rate | Reply Rate |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 0-3 months | 25% | 3% |
| 3-6 months | 22% | 2.5% |
| 6-12 months | 18% | 2% |
| 12-24 months | 12% | 1% |
| 24+ months | 8% | 0.5% |

Declining engagement indicates data decay (wrong people, invalid emails).

### Method 4: CRM freshness audit

Check when records were last updated:

```
Updated in last 90 days: 30%
Updated in last 180 days: 45%
Updated in last year: 65%
Not updated in 1+ year: 35%
```

If 35% of records haven't been updated in a year, expect 8-10% to be completely invalid.

## The Cost of Data Decay

Decay isn't just an inconvenience—it's expensive.

### Direct costs

- **Bounced emails**: Wasted sends, platform costs, credits
- **Wrong numbers**: Sales rep time, call costs
- **Duplicate enrichment**: Paying to enrich the same person twice

### Reputation costs

- **Sender reputation**: High bounces damage deliverability
- **Brand perception**: Wrong names, outdated titles look unprofessional
- **Spam complaints**: Emails to old addresses forward to spam traps

### Opportunity costs

- **Missed contacts**: Right person at right company, wrong email
- **Extended cycles**: Chasing people who left, delays finding replacement
- **Lost pipeline**: Deals that never started because outreach failed

A company with 50,000 contacts experiencing 22% decay loses ~11,000 valid contacts per year. At an average lead value of $50, that's $550,000 in potential pipeline—gone.

## Strategies to Combat Data Decay

### Strategy 1: Continuous verification

Don't verify once and forget. Verify continuously:

- **On entry**: Verify every new lead as it enters
- **Before campaigns**: Verify list before any major send
- **Quarterly refresh**: Re-verify entire database quarterly

[Waterfall enrichment](/product/waterfall-enrichment) includes verification in every lookup.

### Strategy 2: Regular re-enrichment

Enrichment isn't one-time. Re-enrich to catch changes:

- **High-value accounts**: Monthly re-enrichment
- **Active pipeline**: Weekly during deals
- **General database**: Quarterly

When re-enrichment finds someone changed companies, update the record—they're still a potential buyer, just somewhere new.

### Strategy 3: Engagement-based hygiene

Use engagement signals to identify decay:

- **No opens in 6 months**: Flag for verification
- **Bounced email**: Immediately re-enrich
- **Unsubscribed**: Archive, don't delete (they may re-engage elsewhere)

Low engagement often indicates the person has moved on.

### Strategy 4: Trigger-based updates

Monitor for events that indicate changes:

- **LinkedIn job changes**: Person changed roles
- **Funding announcements**: Company is growing/changing
- **M&A news**: Potential email domain changes
- **Leadership announcements**: New contacts to add

Some enrichment platforms offer intent/signal data that can trigger updates.

### Strategy 5: Data quality automation

Build decay prevention into your systems:

- **Validation rules**: Catch bad data before it enters
- **Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate creation
- **Required fields**: Ensure completeness on entry
- **Auto-enrichment**: Fill gaps automatically

Prevention is cheaper than cure.

## Data Hygiene Cadence

Recommended maintenance schedule:

| Activity | Frequency | Scope |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| New lead verification | Real-time | All new leads |
| Campaign list verification | Before each campaign | Campaign segment |
| Bounce processing | Daily | All bounces |
| Duplicate detection | Weekly | New records |
| High-value account refresh | Monthly | Top accounts |
| Full database verification | Quarterly | All contacts |
| Deep enrichment refresh | Semi-annually | Active records |

## Benchmarks: What Good Looks Like

Target these metrics:

| Metric | Poor | Acceptable | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|------------|------|-----------|
| Email bounce rate | >10% | 5-10% | 2-5% | <2% |
| Phone connect rate | <30% | 30-50% | 50-70% | >70% |
| Records updated <90 days | <40% | 40-60% | 60-80% | >80% |
| Duplicate rate | >20% | 10-20% | 5-10% | <5% |
| Field completion rate | <60% | 60-75% | 75-90% | >90% |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I stop data decay completely?

No. People will always change jobs, and companies will always evolve. But you can minimize the impact through continuous verification and enrichment.

### How often should I clean my database?

Quarterly is the minimum for most B2B databases. High-velocity teams (lots of new leads, active outbound) should clean monthly or continuously.

### Is buying new data better than maintaining old data?

Both are necessary. New data expands your reach. Maintained data protects your investment and sender reputation. Don't neglect either.

### What's the ROI of fighting data decay?

Significant. Every 1% improvement in email validity = more successful sends. Every 1% improvement in phone accuracy = more connects. The math compounds.

### How do I prove data decay to leadership?

Run a verification sample. If 20% of "active" contacts fail verification, you have proof. Convert to dollars: 20% of database × average lead value × conversion rate = revenue at risk.
