Your multi-touch attribution model is probably lying to you.

Not because the model is wrong—but because the data feeding it is incomplete, duplicated, and inconsistent. You're running sophisticated attribution on dirty data, then making million-dollar budget decisions based on the results.

The dirty secret of B2B attribution: your data quality matters more than which attribution model you choose.

## Why Attribution Models Fail

The typical attribution conversation focuses on models: first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based, algorithmic. Teams spend months debating which model is "right."

Meanwhile, their data has fundamental problems that make any model unreliable:

### Problem 1: Missing touchpoints

Every missing touchpoint skews attribution. Common gaps:

- **Anonymous website visits**: Before someone fills out a form, you don't know who they are
- **Dark social**: Conversations in Slack, word-of-mouth, podcasts
- **Offline events**: Conference conversations, phone calls not logged
- **Sales touches**: Emails and calls not synced to marketing systems

If your attribution only captures 60% of touchpoints, you're attributing credit based on incomplete data.

### Problem 2: Duplicate contacts

John Smith attends a webinar with john.smith@acme.com. Later, he downloads a whitepaper with jsmith@acme.com. Your system thinks these are two different people.

The webinar gets no credit for John's eventual purchase—even though it was a critical touchpoint—because it's tied to a different contact record.

**Impact**: Channels that capture different email variations get under-credited. Deduplication rates of 10-30% are common in B2B databases.

### Problem 3: Incorrect lead source

Someone clicks a Google ad, then later comes back directly and fills out a form. Your system records "Direct" as the lead source.

Original source: Google Paid. Recorded source: Direct.

Now your attribution says organic/direct drives more pipeline than paid—when the opposite is true.

### Problem 4: Stale data in attribution windows

Attribution windows (30 days, 60 days, 90 days) assume the data is current. But if contact records aren't updated, you're including touchpoints from people who left the company months ago.

They're not going to buy. But your attribution model doesn't know that.

### Problem 5: Missing account associations

B2B purchases involve multiple stakeholders. If contacts aren't properly associated with accounts, you can't see the full buying committee journey.

Attribution might show one champion with 10 touchpoints, but miss the five other stakeholders who influenced the deal.

## Data Quality Metrics for Attribution

Before trusting your attribution, audit these metrics:

### Contact deduplication rate

```
Duplicates / Total Contacts = Duplication Rate
```

**Target**: Under 5%
**Typical**: 15-30%

Every duplicate creates an incomplete touchpoint history.

### Lead source accuracy

Sample 100 recent leads. Verify the recorded source against actual referrer data.

**Target**: 90%+ accuracy
**Typical**: 60-75%

Incorrect sources poison attribution analysis.

### Contact-to-account association

```
Contacts with Account / Total Contacts = Association Rate
```

**Target**: Over 90% for closed-won deals
**Typical**: 70-80%

Unassociated contacts mean incomplete account-level attribution.

### Data completeness

What percentage of contacts have the fields needed for attribution?

| Field | Attribution Need | Typical Completion |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Email | Link touchpoints | 95% |
| Company | Account matching | 80% |
| Lead Source | Channel attribution | 70% |
| First Touch Date | Journey timeline | 60% |

### Data freshness

```
Contacts Updated in Last 90 Days / Total Active Contacts
```

**Target**: Over 80%
**Typical**: 50-70%

Stale data includes people who are no longer at the company or relevant to attribution.

## The Attribution Data Stack

Clean attribution requires clean data at every layer:

### Layer 1: Contact data

Every person in your database needs:
- Verified email (to link touchpoints)
- Current company (to associate with accounts)
- Job title and seniority (to identify buying committee)
- Updated regularly (to remove stale records)

Use [waterfall enrichment](/product/waterfall-enrichment) to fill gaps and keep records current.

### Layer 2: Account data

Every company needs:
- Correct legal name (for matching)
- Domain (for website visitor matching)
- Firmographics (for segmentation)
- All related contacts associated

### Layer 3: Touchpoint capture

Every interaction needs proper tracking:
- Marketing automation events
- Website visits (with identity resolution)
- Sales activities (calls, emails, meetings)
- Product usage (if applicable)

### Layer 4: Attribution infrastructure

Systems that connect everything:
- CRM as single source of truth
- Marketing platform integration
- Data warehouse for analysis
- Attribution tool for modeling

## Fixing Attribution Data Quality

### Step 1: Deduplicate contacts

Before any attribution analysis, merge duplicates:

1. Export all contacts
2. Match on: exact email, fuzzy name + company, phone number
3. Define merge rules (which record survives)
4. Merge and consolidate touchpoint history

**Important**: Merge touchpoint history when deduplicating. Don't just delete duplicates—you'll lose attribution data.

### Step 2: Verify and enrich contact data

Run all contacts through verification and enrichment:

- Verify emails exist
- Update job titles and companies
- Fill missing firmographics
- Flag records that have changed jobs

[Cleanlist enrichment](/product/waterfall-enrichment) updates records with current information from 15+ sources.

### Step 3: Fix lead source data

Audit recent leads for source accuracy:

1. Compare recorded source to UTM parameters and referrer data
2. Identify systematic errors (e.g., all Salesforce imports marked "Direct")
3. Fix the capture mechanism going forward
4. Backfill historical data where possible

### Step 4: Associate contacts with accounts

Ensure every contact is linked to the right account:

1. Match contacts to accounts by email domain
2. Manual review for edge cases (personal emails, shared domains)
3. Create account records for orphan contacts
4. Set up automatic association for new leads

### Step 5: Implement ongoing hygiene

Data quality isn't a one-time project:

- Deduplicate on lead creation (prevent new duplicates)
- Enrich new leads automatically
- Re-verify quarterly
- Monitor data quality metrics monthly

## The Impact of Clean Data on Attribution

When you fix your data, attribution insights change—sometimes dramatically.

### Before cleanup (typical findings)

- "Paid search drives 15% of pipeline"
- "Events are low ROI"
- "Content marketing doesn't work"

### After cleanup (common revelations)

- "Paid search actually drives 25% of pipeline" (was under-counted due to lead source errors)
- "Events drive 2x more influenced pipeline than we thought" (contacts weren't associated to accounts)
- "Content influences 60% of closed-won deals" (duplicates were hiding the journey)

### Case study: What changes with clean data

A B2B SaaS company audited their attribution data:

**Before**:
- 22% duplicate rate in contacts
- 65% lead source accuracy
- 71% contact-to-account association

**After cleanup**:
- 4% duplicate rate
- 92% lead source accuracy
- 94% contact-to-account association

**Attribution changes**:
- LinkedIn Ads: 8% → 14% of pipeline (was under-counted)
- Direct: 35% → 18% of pipeline (was over-counted due to UTM issues)
- Events: 12% → 23% of influenced pipeline (contacts now associated)
- Content: 5% → 18% first-touch (duplicates merged)

They were about to cut LinkedIn Ads budget by 50%. After fixing data, they increased it.

## Model Selection Matters Less Than You Think

Teams debate first-touch vs. last-touch vs. algorithmic attribution. But when data quality is poor, all models are wrong.

| Model | What It Measures | Data Dependency |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| First-touch | Initial source | Requires accurate lead source |
| Last-touch | Closing channel | Requires complete touchpoint capture |
| Linear | All touches equally | Requires all touchpoints linked to single contact |
| Time-decay | Recent touches weighted | Requires accurate timestamps |
| Algorithmic | ML-determined weights | Requires high-volume, clean data |

With dirty data, first-touch credits the wrong source. Last-touch misses the journey. Linear double-counts duplicates. Algorithmic learns from noise.

The model matters far less than whether the data feeding it is accurate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which attribution model should I use?

Start with position-based (40% first, 40% last, 20% middle) as a reasonable baseline. But fix your data quality first—the model matters less than the data.

### How do I track dark social and word-of-mouth?

You can't perfectly track it. Add "How did you hear about us?" to forms with an "Other" option. This captures some dark social. Accept that attribution will never be 100% complete.

### How often should I clean attribution data?

Deduplicate continuously (prevent on entry). Audit lead source monthly. Full data cleanup quarterly. Re-enrich contacts before major attribution reports.

### Can I trust algorithmic attribution?

Only if your data quality is high and you have sufficient volume (usually 1,000+ closed deals). Algorithmic models amplify data quality issues—garbage in, garbage out faster.

### What's the ROI of fixing attribution data?

If you're making budget decisions based on attribution, the ROI is enormous. One company avoided a bad $500K budget cut because fixed data revealed the true channel performance.
