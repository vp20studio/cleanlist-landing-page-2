Your sales emails aren't working. Open rates are decent, but replies? Crickets.

Before you rewrite your copy for the tenth time, consider a different culprit: your data.

Bad data sabotages outreach in ways that aren't immediately obvious. You might be sending great emails to wrong people, outdated addresses, or contacts who can't buy.

Here's how data quality secretly kills your reply rates—and how to fix it.

## The Data Problems Hiding in Plain Sight

### Problem 1: You're emailing the wrong person

You found "Marketing Manager at Acme Corp" and sent your pitch. No response.

What you didn't know: They handle events, not demand gen. Your email about lead enrichment is irrelevant to them.

**The data gap**: Job title alone doesn't tell you what someone actually does. Two "Marketing Managers" at the same company might have completely different responsibilities.

**The fix**: Enrich with department data and seniority. Use [ICP scoring](/product/icp-scoring) to filter for the right personas, not just titles.

### Problem 2: They changed jobs 6 months ago

Your CRM says Sarah is VP of Sales at TechCo. Your email goes to sarah@techco.com. She doesn't reply—because she left in January and now works at a competitor.

B2B data decays at 22.5% per year. One in five contacts in your database is outdated.

**The data gap**: No one updated the record when Sarah changed jobs. She's gone, the email bounces (or worse, goes to her abandoned inbox).

**The fix**: Re-enrich contacts before campaigns. [Waterfall enrichment](/product/waterfall-enrichment) finds current email and company, not just validates old data.

### Problem 3: Wrong email address (but looks right)

john.smith@acmecorp.com looks legitimate. It even passed your format validation.

But Acme Corp uses firstname.lastname@acme-corp.com (with a hyphen). John never got your email because that address doesn't exist.

**The data gap**: Email pattern guessing fails more often than you think. And emails to non-existent addresses bounce, hurting your sender reputation.

**The fix**: Verify every email before sending. Real verification checks if the mailbox actually exists, not just if the format looks right.

### Problem 4: You're in spam

Your emails are well-written, personalized, sent to valid addresses. But 40% land in spam folders because your domain reputation is damaged.

Why? Previous campaigns hit too many invalid addresses. Every bounce taught email providers that your domain sends to bad lists.

**The data gap**: You didn't realize how many bad emails were in your database until the damage was done.

**The fix**: Clean your list ruthlessly. Verify all emails. Aim for under 2% bounce rate to protect sender reputation.

### Problem 5: Right contact, wrong timing

You emailed the CTO about your developer tool. He's the right person—but his company just closed a funding round and is focused on hiring, not buying tools.

**The data gap**: You have contact info but no context about whether it's the right time.

**The fix**: Enrich with firmographic signals—funding, hiring, growth rate. These indicate whether a company is likely in buying mode.

## The Reply Rate Formula

Email reply rates depend on three factors:

```
Reply Rate = Relevance × Deliverability × Timing
```

- **Relevance**: Right message to right person about right problem
- **Deliverability**: Email actually reaches inbox (not spam, not bounce)
- **Timing**: Contact is at a company in position to buy

Most teams obsess over the message (subject lines, copy, personalization) while ignoring deliverability and timing—both of which depend on data quality.

### What the data shows

Research on 100M+ B2B emails reveals:

| Factor | Impact on Reply Rate |
|--------|---------------------|
| Correct title match | +40% |
| Verified email | +60% |
| Updated in last 90 days | +35% |
| Company in growth stage | +45% |
| Domain with good reputation | +80% |

Data quality affects reply rates more than any copywriting trick.

## Audit Your Data Quality

Before your next campaign, check these metrics:

### Email validity

Run your list through verification. What percentage passes?

| Validity Rate | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| 95%+ | Good, proceed |
| 90-95% | Acceptable, but improve |
| 85-90% | Warning, clean before sending |
| Under 85% | Stop, major cleanup needed |

### Bounce rate (last 30 days)

Check your email platform's bounce report:

| Bounce Rate | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Under 2% | Healthy sender reputation |
| 2-5% | Monitor closely |
| 5-10% | Reputation at risk |
| Over 10% | Serious damage, pause sends |

### Data freshness

When were your contact records last updated?

| Last Updated | Risk Level |
|--------------|------------|
| Under 90 days | Low risk |
| 90-180 days | Moderate risk |
| 180-365 days | High risk (re-verify) |
| Over 1 year | Very high risk (re-enrich) |

### Field completion

What percentage of records have the fields you need for targeting?

| Field | Minimum Target |
|-------|---------------|
| Email | 100% (required) |
| Company | 95% |
| Job title | 90% |
| Industry | 80% |
| Company size | 75% |

## Fix Your Data in 5 Steps

### Step 1: Verify all emails

Before any campaign, run every email through verification. Remove invalid addresses. Flag risky ones (catch-all domains).

[Waterfall enrichment](/product/waterfall-enrichment) includes verification—every email returned is confirmed deliverable.

### Step 2: Re-enrich stale records

Any contact not updated in 6+ months needs re-enrichment. People change jobs. Companies get acquired. Emails change.

Don't just validate the old email—enrich to find current data.

### Step 3: Fill data gaps

Records missing key fields can't be properly targeted. If you don't know their company size, you can't exclude SMBs from enterprise campaigns.

Enrich missing firmographics: company size, industry, revenue, growth signals.

### Step 4: Score against your ICP

Not every valid email is a good prospect. Score contacts against your [Ideal Customer Profile](/product/icp-scoring):

- High score (80+): Prioritize
- Medium score (50-79): Nurture
- Low score (under 50): Exclude

Sending to low-ICP contacts tanks reply rates even with perfect data.

### Step 5: Monitor continuously

Data quality isn't a one-time project:

- Verify new leads on entry
- Re-enrich quarterly
- Track bounce rate after every campaign
- Update ICP scoring as you learn

## Beyond Data: What Else Affects Replies

Data quality is necessary but not sufficient. Once your data is clean, these factors matter:

### Subject line

- 40 characters or fewer
- Personalized (company name, trigger event)
- Creates curiosity without being clickbait

### First line

- Reference something specific about them/their company
- Don't start with "I" or "We"
- Prove you did research

### Value proposition

- Focus on their problem, not your features
- Quantify the benefit
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences

### Call to action

- Single, clear ask
- Low commitment (not "buy now," more like "worth a conversation?")
- Easy to say yes to

### Send timing

- Tuesday-Thursday typically best for B2B
- 8-10am local time for executives
- Avoid Mondays and Fridays

## The Compound Effect

Clean data creates a positive feedback loop:

1. Clean emails → Low bounces
2. Low bounces → Good sender reputation
3. Good reputation → Better deliverability
4. Better deliverability → More inbox placement
5. More inbox placement → More replies
6. More replies → More meetings
7. More meetings → More revenue

The reverse is also true. Dirty data creates a death spiral where every campaign makes the next one harder.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What reply rate should I expect?

Cold email: 1-5% is typical, 5-10% is excellent. Warm outreach (inbound, referrals): 10-30%. If you're under 1% with clean data and good copy, your targeting is off.

### How often should I re-verify my list?

Before every major campaign. For ongoing sequences, quarterly is sufficient. For high-volume sending, monthly.

### Should I email catch-all domains?

Proceed with caution. Catch-all domains accept all emails, so they won't bounce—but the mailbox might not exist. Send to catch-alls at lower priority and monitor engagement.

### Can good copy overcome bad data?

No. The best subject line doesn't help if the email bounces or lands in spam. Fix data first, then optimize copy.

### How do I know if I'm in spam?

Check your sender score (senderscore.org), monitor open rates (sudden drops indicate spam filtering), and use tools like GlockApps or Mail Tester to test inbox placement.
