ZoomInfo is the market leader in B2B data. It's also expensive—most companies pay $15,000-40,000+ per year. For startups and SMBs, that's often more than the entire sales tech budget.

The good news: you don't need to pay ZoomInfo prices to get quality B2B data. These 10 alternatives deliver 80-90% of the functionality at a fraction of the cost.

## Why Companies Leave ZoomInfo

Before the alternatives, here's why teams switch:

**Cost**: Annual contracts starting at $15K, scaling to $50K+ with add-ons. Per-seat fees multiply the expense.

**Lock-in**: Multi-year contracts with auto-renewal. Exiting is expensive and time-consuming.

**Data gaps**: Despite the massive database, ZoomInfo still has gaps—especially for smaller companies and emerging markets.

**Complexity**: The full platform includes features most teams don't use. You pay for everything, use 20%.

**Accuracy concerns**: Some teams report 15-20% bounce rates, suggesting database decay issues.

## The Hybrid Approach

Many successful teams combine tools:

**Intent + Accuracy combo**: Use a cheaper intent data source (Bombora, G2) to identify in-market accounts, then enrich those specific accounts with Cleanlist for accurate contact data.

**Prospecting + Verification combo**: Use Apollo or Lusha for initial prospecting, then verify emails through Cleanlist before sending.

**Volume + Quality combo**: Use Apollo for high-volume, low-stakes outreach. Use Cleanlist for strategic accounts where accuracy matters.

## Migration Checklist

Switching from ZoomInfo? Here's what to plan:

1. **Export your data**: Download contacts and accounts before contract ends
2. **Map field equivalents**: Ensure new tool has matching data points
3. **Test accuracy**: Run 100 lookups through new tool, verify results
4. **Train team**: New interface, different workflow
5. **Update integrations**: CRM, outreach tools, enrichment flows
6. **Monitor metrics**: Track bounce rates, connect rates post-switch

## ROI Calculation

Example: 5-person sales team, 10,000 enrichments/year

| Tool | Annual Cost | Bounce Rate | Valid Contacts | Cost/Valid Contact |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| ZoomInfo | $20,000 | 15% | 8,500 | $2.35 |
| Cleanlist | $3,000 | 2% | 9,800 | $0.31 |
| Apollo | $3,500 | 20% | 8,000 | $0.44 |

Cleanlist delivers 7.5x better cost-per-valid-contact than ZoomInfo in this example.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do any alternatives match ZoomInfo's intent data?

Only Cognism (through Bombora partnership) offers comparable intent data. For pure intent signals, ZoomInfo remains unique. However, you can purchase intent data separately from Bombora, G2, or TrustRadius and use a cheaper tool for contact data.

### Will my data accuracy suffer with cheaper tools?

Not necessarily. [Cleanlist's waterfall approach](/product/waterfall-enrichment) actually achieves higher accuracy than ZoomInfo because it queries multiple sources and verifies every email.

### How hard is it to switch from ZoomInfo?

Moderate difficulty. Main challenges: exporting historical data, updating integrations, training team on new workflow. Plan 2-4 weeks for transition.

### Can I negotiate ZoomInfo pricing?

Sometimes. End-of-quarter deals, multi-year commitments, and competitive pressure can reduce pricing 20-30%. But you're still looking at $10K+ minimum.

### Which alternative has the best customer support?

Varies by company size. ZoomInfo offers dedicated support at enterprise tier. Among alternatives, Cognism and Cleanlist are known for responsive support. Apollo support can be slow due to volume.
