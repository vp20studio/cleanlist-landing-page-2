LinkedIn is the best source for B2B leads. Sales Navigator gives you perfect targeting. But LinkedIn only shows you who to contact—not how to contact them.

The obvious solution is scraping. Export profiles, find emails, build your list. But LinkedIn's terms of service prohibit most scraping, and they actively enforce it. Accounts get restricted. Sometimes permanently.

This guide shows you how to enrich LinkedIn leads with verified emails and phone numbers—without getting your account banned.

## Why LinkedIn Restricts Scraping

LinkedIn's business model depends on keeping data inside their platform. If you could export everyone's contact info, you wouldn't need a Sales Navigator subscription.

Their restrictions include:
- **Terms of Service**: Prohibit automated data collection
- **Technical limits**: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, bot detection
- **Legal action**: They've sued scraping companies and won

The consequences:
- Account warnings
- Temporary restrictions
- Permanent account bans
- Legal liability (for companies)

This doesn't mean you can't enrich LinkedIn leads. It means you need to do it the right way.

## What "Compliant" Enrichment Looks Like

Compliant LinkedIn enrichment doesn't scrape LinkedIn. It uses LinkedIn as a starting point, then enriches from other data sources.

### The compliant workflow

1. **Identify prospects on LinkedIn**: Use Sales Navigator to find ideal contacts
2. **Export minimal identifiers**: Name, company, title, LinkedIn URL
3. **Enrich from external sources**: Query data providers for email/phone
4. **Verify contact information**: Confirm emails are deliverable
5. **Outreach via email/phone**: Contact through non-LinkedIn channels

The key distinction: you're not pulling data from LinkedIn. You're using LinkedIn to identify who to research, then finding contact info from other sources.

### What enrichment tools actually do

Good enrichment tools like [Cleanlist](/product/waterfall-enrichment):
1. Take a LinkedIn URL or name + company as input
2. Match that person across 15+ data providers (not LinkedIn)
3. Return verified email and phone from those sources
4. Never store or redistribute LinkedIn data

LinkedIn can't object to you finding publicly available contact information for people you identified on their platform.

## Method 1: Manual LinkedIn + Enrichment

For low-volume prospecting, manual workflow is safest.

### Step-by-step process

1. **Search in Sales Navigator**: Build your search with ICP criteria
2. **Open prospect profiles**: Review each profile manually
3. **Copy key identifiers**:
   - Full name
   - Current company
   - Job title
   - LinkedIn URL
4. **Paste into enrichment tool**: Enter info into Cleanlist
5. **Get verified contact info**: Receive email, phone, company data
6. **Add to your CRM**: Import enriched contacts

### Time investment

- Per profile: 1-2 minutes
- 50 profiles: ~1.5 hours
- Best for: Targeted ABM, executive outreach, high-value accounts

### Staying under LinkedIn's radar

- Don't use browser extensions that auto-collect data
- Don't visit hundreds of profiles per day (triggers detection)
- Mix profile visits with normal LinkedIn activity
- Take breaks between prospecting sessions

<Callout type="info" title="Safe Volume">
LinkedIn rarely restricts accounts that view under 100 profiles per day with normal patterns. Stay under this threshold for manual prospecting.
</Callout>

## Method 2: Sales Navigator Lead Lists + Bulk Enrichment

For higher volume, use Sales Navigator's native export features.

### Using Sales Navigator lists

1. **Build your search**: ICP criteria, account lists, filters
2. **Save leads to a list**: Click "Save" on relevant profiles
3. **Export from Sales Navigator**: Use the native CSV export feature
4. **Upload to enrichment**: Send CSV to Cleanlist
5. **Receive enriched file**: Get emails, phones, firmographics

### What Sales Navigator exports

Native exports include:
- First name, last name
- Job title
- Company name
- Company industry
- Company size
- Geography
- LinkedIn URL

They do NOT include:
- Email address
- Phone number
- Detailed company data

That's where enrichment fills the gap.

### Bulk enrichment workflow

With [Cleanlist's Sales Nav integration](/product/sales-nav-scraper):

1. Connect your Sales Navigator account
2. Select the lead list to enrich
3. Cleanlist processes each profile
4. Waterfall enrichment finds contact info
5. Download complete enriched list

**Result**: Hundreds of leads enriched in minutes, not hours.

## Method 3: Account-Based Enrichment

Instead of enriching individual leads, enrich by company.

### The account-first approach

1. **Build target account list**: Define ICP companies
2. **Upload company list**: Company names and domains
3. **Request contacts by criteria**: "Find VP Sales at each company"
4. **Enrichment returns contacts**: Verified emails and phones
5. **Cross-reference with LinkedIn**: Confirm correct people

### Why this is safer

You're not interacting with LinkedIn at all during enrichment. You're asking your enrichment provider to find contacts at specific companies matching certain criteria.

Then you can verify these are the right people by checking LinkedIn—normal usage that won't trigger restrictions.

### Example workflow

```
Input: Acme Corp, B2B SaaS, 200 employees
Request: VP or Director of Sales/Marketing

Output:
- Sarah Johnson, VP of Sales, sarah.johnson@acme.com, +1-555-123-4567
- Mike Chen, Director of Marketing, m.chen@acme.com, +1-555-987-6543
```

No LinkedIn scraping required.

## Method 4: Event and Intent-Based Enrichment

Enrich leads who've already shown interest.

### Sources that don't involve LinkedIn scraping

- **Website visitors**: De-anonymize and enrich
- **Webinar registrants**: Enrich with missing fields
- **Content downloaders**: Enrich incomplete forms
- **Event badge scans**: Enrich with full contact info

### Webinar enrichment example

1. Person registers with name and email only
2. Upload registrant list to Cleanlist
3. Enrichment adds: job title, company, phone, firmographics
4. [ICP Scoring](/product/icp-scoring) prioritizes high-fit attendees
5. Sales follows up with complete context

No LinkedIn involved, but you get the same result: complete contact records.

## Tools That Keep You Compliant

### What to look for

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Non-LinkedIn data sources | Doesn't violate ToS |
| API-based enrichment | No browser extension risk |
| Verification included | Confirms data accuracy |
| CRM integration | Clean workflow, no manual steps |

### What to avoid

- Browser extensions that auto-scrape profiles
- Tools that store LinkedIn data
- Services that offer "unlimited LinkedIn exports"
- Chrome plugins that collect data while you browse

<Callout type="warning" title="Red Flag">
If a tool promises to "export thousands of LinkedIn profiles automatically," they're likely violating LinkedIn's terms—and putting your account at risk.
</Callout>

### Cleanlist's approach

[Cleanlist](/product/waterfall-enrichment) enriches from 15+ data sources that don't include LinkedIn:
- Business data providers
- Public records
- Company websites
- Email verification services

You use LinkedIn to identify who you want to reach. Cleanlist finds how to reach them—from other sources.

## Handling LinkedIn Account Restrictions

If you've already received a restriction:

### Warning messages

LinkedIn warning about "unusual activity":
1. Stop all automation immediately
2. Reduce profile viewing volume
3. Wait 24-48 hours before normal use
4. Don't use any browser extensions

### Temporary restrictions

Can't send messages or connection requests:
1. Wait for the restriction period (usually 24-72 hours)
2. Review what triggered it (excessive actions)
3. Adjust behavior when restored
4. Consider using email outreach instead

### Account review

LinkedIn asks you to verify identity:
1. Provide requested verification
2. Explain legitimate sales use case
3. Wait for review (can take days)
4. If restored, dramatically reduce automated activity

### Permanent ban

Account terminated:
1. You can appeal, but success rate is low
2. Create a new account (use real identity)
3. Never use the same browser extensions
4. Consider alternative prospecting channels

## Building a Sustainable Prospecting System

Long-term, the goal is reducing LinkedIn dependency.

### Diversify lead sources

Don't rely solely on LinkedIn:
- Industry conferences and events
- Content marketing and inbound
- Referrals from existing customers
- Community engagement
- Direct outreach via verified email

### Build your own database

Every enriched contact should go into your CRM:
- Capture complete contact records
- Update when people change jobs
- Track engagement and outcomes
- Re-enrich periodically to maintain accuracy

Over time, you'll have a proprietary database that doesn't depend on LinkedIn access.

### Use email as primary channel

LinkedIn InMail is expensive and limited. Verified email is:
- Unlimited volume
- Lower cost per contact
- Higher response rates (when personalized)
- Not dependent on LinkedIn account status

Enrich once, email forever.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it legal to enrich LinkedIn leads?

Enriching from external data sources is legal. Scraping LinkedIn directly may violate their terms of service (contract issue, not legal). The distinction is where the contact data comes from—LinkedIn or other sources.

### Will LinkedIn know I'm enriching leads?

Not if you're doing it correctly. Enrichment tools query their own data sources, not LinkedIn. LinkedIn only sees normal profile viewing activity on your end.

### How many profiles can I view per day safely?

Under 100 manual profile views per day rarely triggers issues. Over 200 starts to look automated. Over 500 will likely trigger restrictions. Mix with normal LinkedIn activity.

### What if I need thousands of leads?

Use account-based enrichment instead of profile-based. Give Cleanlist your target company list and criteria—it finds contacts without you viewing LinkedIn profiles at all.

### Can I use browser extensions?

We don't recommend it. Most extensions that collect LinkedIn data put your account at risk. Use API-based enrichment tools instead.
