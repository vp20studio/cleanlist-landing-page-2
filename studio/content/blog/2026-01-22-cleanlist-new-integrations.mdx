We've expanded our integration ecosystem. Cleanlist now connects natively with 15+ tools across your GTM stack—including Clay, HubSpot, Salesforce, and more.

Set up once, and enriched data flows automatically wherever you need it.

## New Integrations

### Clay

Clay users can now enrich with Cleanlist's waterfall enrichment directly in their Clay tables.

**What it does**:
- Add Cleanlist as an enrichment source in Clay
- Query 15+ data providers through one API
- Get verified emails and phone numbers
- Pay only for successful enrichments

**How to set up**:
1. In Clay, go to **Integrations**
2. Search for **Cleanlist**
3. Add your Cleanlist API key

Clay + Cleanlist = waterfall enrichment without building custom integrations.
