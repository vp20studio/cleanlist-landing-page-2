Bad data costs B2B companies 15-25% of their revenue. Bounced emails tank deliverability. Wrong phone numbers waste rep time. Incomplete records break automations.

Cleanlist exists to fix this. We built a data platform specifically for GTM teams—combining enrichment, verification, and transformation in one place. No more duct-taping five different tools together.

This guide covers every Cleanlist feature and how each one helps you ship cleaner data, faster.

## The Numbers Behind Cleanlist

Before diving into features, here's what powers the platform:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Contact database | 400M+ records |
| Email coverage | 98% |
| Phone find rate | 85% |
| Data providers | 15+ premium sources |
| Companies using Cleanlist | 100+ |

These aren't vanity metrics. They translate directly to more complete records, fewer bounces, and higher connect rates for your outbound campaigns.

## Feature 1: Waterfall Enrichment

**The problem**: Single-source data providers have gaps. You pay for enrichment and still end up with incomplete records.

**The solution**: [Waterfall enrichment](/product/waterfall-enrichment) queries 15+ premium data providers in sequence until it finds complete, verified information.

### How it works

1. Your input record enters the cascade
2. Provider 1 is queried—if they have verified data, we capture it
3. If gaps remain, we cascade to Provider 2, then Provider 3, and so on
4. Each response is validated (email syntax, deliverability, freshness)
5. The best data from each provider merges into one "golden record"

### What you get

- **Partial enrichment (1 credit)**: Verified work email, LinkedIn URL, company data
- **Full enrichment (11 credits)**: Everything above + direct dial phone, mobile number, complete firmographics

### Output fields (25+)

Contact data: verified email, personal email, direct phone, mobile, LinkedIn, Twitter, full name, job title, department, seniority level.

Company data: name, domain, industry, employee count, revenue range, headquarters, founded year, tech stack, funding stage.

Metadata: confidence score, sources used, last verified date, processing time.

Most customers see 20-30% higher fill rates compared to single-source tools.

## Feature 2: People Search

**The problem**: You have a target account list but no contact details. Manually finding emails and phones takes hours.

**The solution**: [People Search](/product/people-search) discovers contacts from LinkedIn profiles and Sales Navigator with one click.

### Key capabilities

- **LinkedIn lookup**: Paste a profile URL, get verified email and phone
- **Company search**: Enter a company name, get decision-maker contacts
- **Bulk discovery**: Upload a list of companies, get contacts for each
- **Role filtering**: Search by title, department, seniority level

### Use cases

- Building prospect lists for outbound campaigns
- Finding the right contact at target accounts
- Expanding your database with net-new leads
- Validating contacts before outreach

People Search connects directly to our enrichment engine, so every contact returned is already verified.

## Feature 3: ICP Scoring

**The problem**: Not all leads are equal. Your sales team wastes time on poor-fit prospects while ideal customers slip through.

**The solution**: [ICP Scoring](/product/icp-scoring) automatically scores and ranks every lead against your Ideal Customer Profile.

### Define your ICP with granular criteria

**Company targeting:**
- Industries and sub-categories
- Company size (startup to enterprise)
- Revenue ranges ($0-$1M to $1B+)
- Tech stack requirements
- Business models (B2B, B2C, SaaS, marketplace)
- Growth signals (hiring, funding, expansion)

**Prospect targeting:**
- Job titles and variations
- Departments (Sales, Marketing, Engineering)
- Seniority levels (C-Suite, VP, Director, Manager)
- Years of experience
- Skills and certifications

**Geographic targeting:**
- Countries, states, cities
- Timezone alignment
- Negative geo targeting (exclusions)

### How scoring works

Each lead is evaluated against your ICP criteria and assigned a score from 0-100. Higher scores indicate better fit.

- **90-100**: Perfect fit—prioritize immediately
- **70-89**: Strong fit—include in primary sequences
- **50-69**: Moderate fit—consider for nurture campaigns
- **Below 50**: Poor fit—deprioritize or exclude

Scores update automatically as you enrich more data or adjust your ICP definition.

## Feature 4: Smart Columns

**The problem**: Your CRM data is messy. Job titles are inconsistent ("VP Sales" vs "Vice President of Sales" vs "VP, Sales"). Phone numbers have different formats. Names are parsed wrong.

**The solution**: [Smart Columns](/product/smart-columns) uses AI to normalize and transform data automatically.

### Transformation types

**Job title normalization**: Convert "VP Sales" → "Vice President of Sales" or standardize to your preferred format.

**Name parsing**: Split "John Smith" into First Name: "John", Last Name: "Smith". Handle edge cases like "Dr. Mary Jane Watson-Parker III".

**Phone formatting**: Standardize to E.164 format (+1 555 123 4567) or any custom format you need.

**Industry categorization**: Map free-text industries to standardized categories (NAICS, SIC, or custom).

**Company name cleanup**: Remove Inc., LLC, Ltd. suffixes or standardize them.

### How to use it

Smart Columns accepts natural language prompts. Just describe what you want:

- "Normalize all job titles to title case"
- "Extract the domain from email addresses"
- "Flag any phone numbers that aren't US-based"
- "Categorize companies by employee count into Small/Medium/Enterprise"

No formulas. No code. Just describe the transformation in plain English.

## Feature 5: Sales Nav Scraper

**The problem**: You've built the perfect Sales Navigator search but exporting contacts manually is tedious. And the exports come without verified contact details.

**The solution**: [Sales Nav Scraper](/product/sales-nav-scraper) bulk exports your Sales Navigator lists and enriches them automatically.

### Workflow

1. Build your search in LinkedIn Sales Navigator
2. Connect Cleanlist to your Sales Navigator account
3. Select the list or search you want to export
4. Cleanlist extracts all profiles and runs enrichment
5. Download complete contact records (email, phone, company data)

### Benefits over manual export

- **Speed**: Export thousands of profiles in minutes, not hours
- **Completeness**: Every record is enriched through the waterfall
- **Accuracy**: Emails are verified, phones are validated
- **No copy-paste**: Direct integration eliminates manual data entry

This is particularly valuable for [sales teams](/use-cases/sales-teams) running ABM campaigns against defined account lists.

## Feature 6: Playbook Builder

**The problem**: Setting up GTM workflows requires engineering resources. Connecting data sources, building enrichment flows, syncing to CRMs—it takes weeks.

**The solution**: [Playbook Builder](/product/playbook-builder) offers pre-built GTM playbooks you can deploy in minutes.

### Available playbooks

**Outbound Sales Playbook**
- Ingest leads from any source

### No engineering required

## How It All Connects

These features aren't siloed—they work together:

1. **People Search** finds contacts at your target accounts
2. **Waterfall Enrichment** fills in verified emails and phones
3. **Smart Columns** normalizes job titles and company data
4. **ICP Scoring** ranks leads by fit
5. **Playbook Builder** pushes everything to your CRM

The result: complete, clean, scored records flowing into your sales tools automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Credit-based pricing. Partial enrichment costs 1 credit per record, full enrichment costs 11 credits. No monthly minimums on most plans. See [pricing](/pricing) for details.

### Can I try before buying?
