We've added AI-powered job title normalization to [Smart Columns](/product/smart-columns). Now you can automatically standardize messy job titles across your entire database—no manual cleanup required.

## The Problem

Job titles in CRM data are notoriously inconsistent. The same role might appear as:

- VP Sales
- VP of Sales
- Vice President Sales
- Vice President of Sales
- Vice President, Sales
- VP - Sales
- V.P. Sales

Multiply this across thousands of contacts, and you have a segmentation nightmare. Your "VP-level" segment misses half the VPs because their titles don't match your filters.

Lead scoring breaks. Routing rules fail. Campaign targeting gets messy.

## The Solution

Smart Columns now uses AI to understand job titles semantically, not just match strings.

### How it works

1. Upload or connect your data
2. Select the job title column
3. Choose "Normalize Job Titles"
4. AI analyzes each title's meaning
5. Output: Standardized titles in your preferred format

### What the AI understands

The model recognizes:

**Seniority levels**:
- C-Suite (CEO, CTO, CFO, etc.)
- VP/Vice President
- Director
- Manager
- Individual Contributor

**Departments**:
- Sales
- Marketing
- Engineering
- Finance
- Operations
- Human Resources
- Product

**Role variations**:
- "Head of Growth" → VP Marketing
- "Revenue Leader" → VP Sales
- "Full-Stack Dev" → Software Engineer
- "People Operations" → HR Manager

### Customizable output

Choose your normalization format:

**Option 1: Title Case Standard**
- Input: "vp sales"
- Output: "Vice President of Sales"

**Option 2: Abbreviated**
- Input: "Vice President of Sales"
- Output: "VP Sales"

**Option 3: With Department Extraction**
- Input: "vp sales"
- Output: Title: "Vice President", Department: "Sales"

**Option 4: Seniority Extraction**
- Input: "Senior Director of Marketing"
- Output: Title: "Senior Director of Marketing", Seniority: "Director"

## Use Cases

### Better lead scoring

Before: Your scoring model gives +10 points for "VP" in title. "Vice President of Sales" gets 0 points because the string "VP" isn't present.

After: All VP-equivalent titles normalize to a standard format. Scoring works consistently.

### Accurate segmentation

Before: Campaign targeting "Directors and above" requires listing every possible title variation.

After: Normalized seniority field lets you filter simply: Seniority = Director OR Seniority = VP OR Seniority = C-Suite.

### Clean reporting

Before: "Contacts by Title" report shows 500 unique titles, most being variations of the same role.

After: Normalized titles consolidate variations. Report shows 30 meaningful role categories.

### ICP matching

Use normalized titles with [ICP Scoring](/product/icp-scoring):
- Target: "Director or VP of Sales/Marketing"
- Match: Any title that normalizes to those criteria

## How to Use It

### In the Cleanlist dashboard

1. Go to **Smart Columns**
2. Select your dataset
3. Click **Add Transformation**
4. Choose **Normalize Job Titles**
5. Select your output format
6. Run transformation

### Via API

```json
POST /api/v1/transform
{
  "data": [
    {"title": "vp sales"},
    {"title": "Vice President, Marketing"},
    {"title": "head of growth"}
  ],
  "transformations": [
    {

      "output_field": "normalized_title",
      "extract_seniority": true,
      "extract_department": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "title": "vp sales",
      "normalized_title": "Vice President of Sales",
      "seniority": "VP",
      "department": "Sales"
    },
    {
      "title": "Vice President, Marketing",
      "normalized_title": "Vice President of Marketing",
      "seniority": "VP",
      "department": "Marketing"
    },
    {
      "title": "head of growth",
      "normalized_title": "Vice President of Marketing",
      "seniority": "VP",
      "department": "Marketing"
    }
  ]
}
```

### In CRM workflows

Set up automatic normalization:
1. Connect Cleanlist to HubSpot/Salesforce
2. Create workflow: "When new contact created"
3. Action: Normalize job title via Cleanlist
4. Update: Write normalized title to custom field

New contacts get normalized titles automatically.
